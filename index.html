                            <p class="intro">My name is Sarah. Thank you for coming across my profile! I completed my Master of Counselling Psychology at Adler University and I am a Registered Clinical Counsellor with the British Columbia Association of Clinical Counsellors (BCACC). I am also pursuing my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (PsyD) at Adler University.</p>
                            
                            <p>I am Syrian – Canadian and was raised in the United Arab Emirates. I moved to Canada when I was 17 years old to peruse my passion in psychology. I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology at York University.</p>
                            
                            <p>My background has allowed me to develop a strong sense of cultural identity and appreciation for the value of diversity. My experiences have given me a unique perspective on mental health that I bring into my work. I value spending time with loved ones, writing poetry, exploring, and creating meaningful content regarding mental health. I believe finding activities that bring joy and fulfilment into a person's life is essential.</p>

                            <p>I believe therapy is a collaborative and supportive space between you and I, in which we can work together to identify and achieve your goals. The therapy room is a space for you to feel safe and comfortable. By creating that, we can then work together to peel back the layers of who you are, explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and work on making positive changes in your life.</p>

                            <p>I am strongly committed to helping others through therapy, and I approach my work from a non-judgmental and compassionate stance. I believe that you are your greatest strength and I am here with you. You do not need to be alone in this journey.</p>

                            <p>I offer individual therapy for adults in both English and Arabic, as language can be an important barrier to accessing mental health care. I take a holistic approach to therapy, as this allows me to consider many factors that can impact your mental health and well-being. By considering your past experiences, childhood, environment, intersectionality and identity, I can understand who you are and how these elements may be influencing your current situation.</p>

                            <p>I use various therapy modalities, including:</p>
                            <ul class="therapy-list">
                                <li>Trauma-Informed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT)</li>
                                <li>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</li>
                                <li>Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT)</li>
                                <li>Motivational Interviewing</li>
                                <li>Mindfulness/Somatic</li>
                                <li>Attachment Theory</li>
                                <li>Gottman Couples Therapy, Level 1</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="consultation-note">If you want to learn more about who I am and how therapy would look, please feel free to book a consultation with me. I am more than happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have. I look forward to us connecting!</p>
